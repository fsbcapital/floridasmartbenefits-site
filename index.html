      <h2>The economic context</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          Florida’s business landscape is overwhelmingly composed of small enterprises. Small firms represent the vast majority of businesses, yet a smaller share of total employment because many are micro-employers, while a smaller number of large employers concentrate a disproportionate share of jobs due to scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Florida has also experienced strong population growth and sustained labor demand, intensifying competition for talent. In parallel, benefits costs can materially affect total compensation structures—making predictability and governance in benefits strategy economically relevant for SMEs.
